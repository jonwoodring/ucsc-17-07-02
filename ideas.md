# Some project ideas #
## I might have too large of a scope, so you might need to scale back for class quarter ##

- Participate in the SciVis 2017 contest
  - https://www.dkrz.de/SciVis 
- Develop continuous "visualization" integration for a project
  - i.e., like how TravisCI will run tests, do automatic visualization and plots
    - Contribute to open source simulations, like the proxy apps, such that when the code is checked in a small simulation is run and visualized
      - https://codesign.llnl.gov
      - https://github.com/lanl
- Develop a kernel for Jupyter for your favorite language with integrated plotting
- Develop an inline markdown Jupyter
  - Like how RMarkdown works in RStudio - literate interactive programming with plotting
  - Rather than discrete cells, you write one markdown document that can be interactively executed
- Contribute a new visualization or analysis filter for either
  - ParaView
  - VTK
  - VisIt
- Develop and deploy a web-enabled visualization of some data of interest
  - Dynamic data that it pulls from web sources
- Add ParaView and/or VTK inline plotting in Jupyter
- Add ParaView and/or VTK inline plotting in RMarkdown/RStudio
